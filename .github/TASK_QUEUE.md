Status: DONE
Requested: 2026-04-06
Completed: 2026-04-06

Changes across 7 files: frame-cached getAll() in 4 modules, shared geometry in tracers.js, hoisted raycasters/temp vectors in weapons.js + vehicles.js, renderer downgrades (antialias off, lower shadows, adaptive quality). QA found and fixed 2 bugs: particle scale with unit geometry and cached array mutation.
